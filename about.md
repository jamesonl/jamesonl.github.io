Hello! I'm Jameson.

Fundamentally, I beleive that **all problems are systems problems.** To break down these systems requires that we understand ourselves, the systems that we create, and how those systems change over time. This process of understanding, experimentation, and reconfiguration dictates how individuals and groups alike address [wicked problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem)!

Online, I also go by [mimoemergence](https://twitter.com/mimoemergence). My passion is for exploring the concept of [emergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) when looking at how people change the way they work with other people, technology, and/or methodologies.

More succinctly put:
 - How can changing the way we think improve our ability to solve more complex problems?
 - How does changing the way we work (with others, technology, or the methods applied) magnify the output of our tasks beyond the original goal?
 - How can system thinking unlock this pattern of thinking for other?

Explaining this to others has often not easy - specifically because:  
 1. Deep, domain-specific problems often are difficult to explain.
 2. To propose and defend multi-disciplinary solutions requires explanation of history, examples of application, and a broader analysis of the benefits outside of the direct problem.

Thus the reason for this blog: to capture my notes, thoughts, and expanded conclusions based on the things I read, watch, and people that I meet.

Personally, I also look at this blog as an opportunity to develop my own voice as a writer, to test my limits (both logically and creatively), as well as document my own thoughts in such a way that can connect me to others long after I have worked on something.

The initial inspiration for my desire to write stemmed from my interest in [tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/). It was many, _many_ articles later that I came to the conclusion (supported by so many other authors) that **how** we imagine problems will dictate the kind of solutions that we will imagine. By altering the way we create solutions (the way we think), we can select and build upon so many MORE opportune / fruitful solutions.

My focus on **emergence**, is in my fundamental belief that the habits we form around technology are mutated when outside of the individual context. The expectation that individual tools lead to more effective teams must be cast aside! I will share my own theories for how emergence can be observed at the group, company, community levels... etc., and how YOU (the reader) should apply these concepts to your own life.

I hope that you enjoy my writings, and always feel free to reach out to me! I'm always keen to collaborate and learn about others.
