>Big things have small beginnings. - Michael Fassbender

A list of the topics that I will cover in my analysis of tools for thought and systems theory (in no particular order):
 - The properties of networks (#emergence)
 - Workflows for managing complexity (#workflows)
 - System(s) design, post-mortems, and critiques (#systems)
 - Examples of tools that change human/machine behavior (#tools)
 - My own experiences building software tools (#experience)

>"Life is about transformation." - Guillermo Rabadan Jenaro

Managing transformation is a difficult process, often challenging and requires time to adjust through. One which cannot be managed alone!

To simplify, I've put together a few resources for others to help me in my journey!

**List of Resources:**
 - [Tools for thought discord community](https://discord.gg/XecXSxV)
 - My Reading List page (contains read and to-be read resources)
 - My [twitter](https://twitter.com/mimoemergence)
