## Principles

1. Use generous whitespace and single-pixel rules.
2. Prefer uppercase kickers and typewriter pacing for headings.
3. Keep accent moments to underlines and hover states.

## Checklist

- Audit new components for contrast on pure black and white.
- Keep animations subtle—think cursor blinks, not fireworks.
- Export assets with dithering if images are required.
