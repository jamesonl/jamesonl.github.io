### Cadence

- Monday: map systems, identify friction, sketch interventions.
- Wednesday: replay signals gathered from qualitative interviews.
- Friday: ship a digest that captures decisions, open threads, and gratitude.

### Rituals

> Write the report before the meeting.

No slides. Send the story, ask for margin notes, then gather live to decide.
